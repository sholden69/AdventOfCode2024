# How did GPT 4o do?   CORRECT

## Day 7 - Part 1
It got it wrong the first time but once i told it that it was too low it was able to work out it had an evaluation order problem;

> Left-to-Right Evaluation: 
> Standard Python eval() follows operator precedence, but the puzzle specifies left-to-right evaluation.
> A custom evaluate_left_to_right() function was added to handle this correctly.


## Day 7 - Part 2
Got this right first time although its quite slow. I asked it to optimise which it did but then i got a few issues:
- Optimised code was wrong.  Gave it the input file and correct answer to check against
- Changed code didnt even run. Reminded it that it needed to check its code and it then rewrote.
- didnt get to an optimised solution
