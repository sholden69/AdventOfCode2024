# How did GPT 4o do?   FAIL

## Day 6 - Part 1
This time it didnt get a correct solution even to part 1. Its initial solution got stuck in a loop and then when i got it to correct that
it generated an incorrect answer of 5010 rather than 4988

However, quite impressed with its reasoning capabilities when i uploaded the test file. It was clearly trying things and running in the background but it didnt get it right

I found a very neat solution on reddit which uses complex numbers as the grid representation. It was able to parse that correctly and explain how it works. 

I then asked it to use "what it had learned to correct its original code without resorting to the complex number approach". It still got it wrong

I then gave it debugging advice and told it to run both programs and see what the 12 extra states are. it worked out that it was missing some states as well as having extra ones.
