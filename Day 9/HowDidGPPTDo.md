# How did GPT 4o do?   CORRECT

## Day 9 - Part 1
It got it wrong initially but after a conversation reviewing and confirming that its logic is correct it thought again

## Day 9 - part 2
Familiar problem of it getting the solution wrong and then toiling to find the problem. I think OpenAI have created some
log, run, debug capabilities but they seem to struggle.
However, given a working and elegant solution from reddit, GPT is able to explain very well what it does and produces
a niceer commented and sub-routined version of the code which is easier to understand and come back to.

It shows what GPT can do as an agent to discuss code with.
