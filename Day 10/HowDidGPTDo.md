# How did GPT do - Day 10

## Part 1
- Didnt get it right out of the box
- Presented me with its reasoning but i didnt check
- I told it its answer was too low and presented it with the input file after which it diagnosed a few potential sources of error
- It was able to do quite a lot of debugging on its own and come up with a second attempt
- Just got stalled though
